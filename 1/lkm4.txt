Notes:

1. A larger stride means that fewer memory locations are accessed, leading to lower physical memory usage, as each access skips over a larger section of the memory.

2. As the number of pages increases, the physical memory size increases as well, regardless of the stride value.

3. As the stride increases, fewer physical pages are mapped, resulting in lower memory usage.
